excerpt: "About Me..."
---

My name is Marcelo Wilchinski and I am a poltical scientist currently pursuing my master’s degree at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, Argentina. I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Political Science at Universidad de la República (UdelaR) in 2020 and two postgradute diplomas in Economics (2021) and International Studies (2020-2022) at the same university. 

My main research interests lie in the intersection between Political Geography, Historical Political Economy, and political regimes with a regional focus on Latin America. Also, I have strong methodological interests in causal inference, spatial econometrics, and quantitative, experimental and quasi-experimental methods. Particularly, I am interested in asking the question: how do economic and political geography shape political regimes? To answer this, I study the long-run effects of the interplay between economic and political geography and international influences on political regime types, primarily, but not entirely, through the state formation and state-building processes.

## Research Interests:                   

- Political Regimes
- Political Geography
