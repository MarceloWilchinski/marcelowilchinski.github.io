My name is Marcelo Wilchinski, and I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I earned my bachelor's degree in Political Science from the Universidad de la Rep√∫blica (UdelaR, Uruguay) in 2020, followed by two postgraduate diplomas in Economics (2021) and International Studies (2022), also from UdelaR.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Political Geography and Historical Political Economy, with a particular focus on the state formation processes in 19th-century Latin America.

## Research Interests:                   

- State Formation
- State-Building
